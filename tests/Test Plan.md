### 1.6 Document Structure

n/a

## 2. Evaluation Mission and Test Motivation

The use-case that is supposed to be tested is "login". Authentification is a key functionality in our application. Ensuring the reliability, functionality and stability as well as the performance of this important feature helps ensuring the sustained quality of our code. 
The whole project benefits of high quality in automated tests. Regular development of tests enables us to use test-driven development and ensures consistent quality.

### 2.1 Background

The login of our application is solved using a username and a session key which is used to connect users. 
There is no password. This is the easiest way for users to get into a session and recognize each other by usernames.

Testing serves to ensure that the written code does what it is intended to do. It also prevents future code changes to break existing functionality unnoticed. In the context of integration it can also prevent broken software states to be merged into secured VC branches

### 2.2 Evaluation Mission

We are eager to find important problems and bugs which could be for example a error caused by wrong input. 
Verifying high standards in our software whilst testing the features promised by the tested code. 
This way we are raising the quality of our product. 

### 2.3 Test Motivators

We want to ensure the funcitonality of our use-cases.

## 3. Target Test Items

We save our unit tests inside the repository where our application is saved.

## 4. Outline of Planned Tests

We are planning on covering as many use-cases as possible. 
In case of our "login"-use-case we are looking at the scenarios "successful login", "empty username", "empty inputs" and "empty session link". 
This way we over all possibilities we could think of. 

### 4.1 Outline of Test Inclusions

we are planning on implementing the following tests during the course of our project:
Backend: Spring Boot Application:

- Unit testing
- Integration testing
- Api testing

The tests themself will not be tested and will not account into code coverage.

### 4.2 Outline of Other Candidates for Potential Inclusion

Testing the functionalities of the participiant as well as the presenter may cause the need of different tests for different environments. 
This will require further investigation.

### 4.3 Outline of Test Exclusions

We are not going to do Database tests.

## 5. Test Approach

Our tests are supposed to be working, stable tests with accurate descriptions. We are trying to achieve useful scenarios. 
We want to test the coorporation between different components and dynamic change of data using integration tests.
We also need to test the functionality of our naviation in the UI. This is going to be implemented using Selenium. There will be different tests for participiant- and presenterview.
Unit Tests are going to be used to test different components one at a time. 

### 5.1 Initial Test-Idea Catalogs and Other Reference Sources

Our SRS is going to provide the informaiton about use-cases that require testing. 
Furthermore we have designed UML-diagrams that explaing our use-cases in more detail.

### 5.2 Testing Techniques and Types

|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Technique Objective    |  We are going to use JUnit and Mockito to mock code and trigger features   |
|Technique              |  We are going to simulate the input of different strings in the fields "username" and "session code"  |
|Oracles                |    We are looking for a login-token to test the outcome of the authentication| 
|Required Tools         |    Mockito, Spring-Boot, JUnit 5|
|Success Criteria       |   A valid token is returned|
|Special Considerations |    We are using a mock of our database|

#### 5.2.3 User Interface Testing

Angular Tests jasmine (Selenium?) 


|                       | Description                                                         |

|Technique Objective    | ensuring quality and functionality of our frontend. The User Interface is supposed to work like intended and provide all functionalities needed by the user|
|Technique              |  Using Selenium and Jasmine we can test components separately but also control the functionality of groups of components  |
|Oracles                |  We expect all steps of different features to work properly and show up the way we intend them to do   |
|Required Tools         |   We are going to test using Jasmine and Selenium. This way we are covering all possible bugs |
|Success Criteria       |   the frontend has to work as intended. Data exchange and looks need to be tested|
|Special Considerations |   separate tests for presenter and participant may be needed  |

#### 5.2.8 Security and Access Control Testing

|                       | Description                                                         |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Technique Objective    |We want to find bugs related to security and access control |
|Technique              | we try to detect security issues using automated tests   |
|Oracles                |  We implement tests for successful behaviours and tests that are supposed to create errors. |
|Required Tools         |  JUnit 5, Mockito, SonarCloud, IntelliJ and Github   |
|Success Criteria       |  There are no security related bugs|
|Special Considerations | Testing the security of our system is extremely important. We will review the security tests in a group of at least 3 people|

We worked out our risk table in [week 2 of this semester](https://lecturefeed.wordpress.com/2022/04/16/week-2-2/)

| Risk           | Mitigation Strategy |
|----------------|---------------------|
|Inexperienced team  | We share experience and learn new technologies regularily                                                                                           |                                      
|Unexpected workload caused by other lectures                |  We start with the important tasks and try to finish most of our scope before the first exam                   |                                       
|Undefined team workflows  |   Define rules and workflows and make sure everybody knows and follows those                                   
|Users don't have access to a local network or a device       |       Users can access a session on mobile devices. We provide a tutorial for alternative usage other than laptops              |
